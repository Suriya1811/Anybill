# Enhanced CSS Summary

## Overview
I've completely enhanced the CSS styling across the MyBillPro application to make it:
- Simpler and more maintainable
- Richer and more aesthetic with a clean, professional design
- Faster and smoother with optimized performance
- Fully responsive on all devices
- Using a minimal, sophisticated color palette

## Key Improvements

### 2. Enhanced Typography

### 4. Optimized Animations
